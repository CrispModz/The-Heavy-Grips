# The-Heavy-Grips
A project that allows you to feel the weight of an object that you pick up inside of virtual reality.

Note that, in order for these to work and be able to connect to SteamVR, you first need to make a pair of [LucidGloves](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves), before you can start.

If you are going to print these, I recommend using a resin 3d printer, or you could use machined aluminum if you want(might last longer).
