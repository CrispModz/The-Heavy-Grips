# The-Heavy-Grips
A project that allows you to feel the weight of an object that you pick up inside of virtual reality.

If your going to print these, I recommend using a resin 3d printer(for better quality), or you could use machined aluminum if you want(might last longer).

-Please note that this project is still really early on in development and not yet final.
