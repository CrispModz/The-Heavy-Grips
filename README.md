# The-Heavy-Grips
A project that allows you to feel the weight of an object that you pick up inside of virtual reality.

Note that, in order for it to work and be able to connect, you need to first have made a pair of [LucidGloves](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves).

If your going to print these, I recommend using a resin 3d printer, or you could use machined aluminum if you want(might last longer).

-Please note that this project is still really early on in development and not yet final.
